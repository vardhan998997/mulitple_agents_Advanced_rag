1. POC / MVP / Product Idea
Study Circle – Peer Connection & Course Exchange Platform
Study Circle is a web-based learning platform that enables students to connect with peers who have complementary skills and mutually exchange courses or knowledge in a structured and collaborative way. The platform focuses on peer-to-peer learning instead of paid or one-directional mentorship models.
2. Problem Statement & How This Idea Solves It
Problem Statement
Students today face three major challenges in learning:
Learning platforms are costly and one-directional
Students possess skills, but there is no system to exchange them
Lack of peer accountability leads to low consistency and motivation
There is no structured platform that allows students to connect with peers and mutually exchange skills or courses in a fair and organized manner.
How the Idea Solves the Problem
Study Circle solves this by:
Connecting students based on what they know and what they want to learn
Enabling mutual skill or course exchange, not one-way teaching
Providing a structured workflow: match → connect → exchange → feedback
Example (Very Clear & Practical)
Student A knows Data Structures and wants to learn React
Student B knows React and wants to learn Data Structures
The platform matches them and enables a mutual exchange, where:
Student A teaches Data Structures
Student B teaches React
No payment involved. Both benefit equally
